# Personal Bash Tooling Setup

Expected entrypoint is creation of a symbolic link for your `~/.bashrc` to `bashrc.sh` at the top-level of this repository

E.g.,
```shell
$ ln -s ~/bash-tools/bashrc.sh ~/.bashrc
```

The same could be done for aliases as well from `~/.bash_aliases` to `aliases.sh` in this repository
